          Welcome to the Wild Woods. Here you will find a merry band of
          facilitators who lounge about regaling one another about the stories
          of code and about their trips into the Codespace. Here in this
          clearing we organize Agile Sprints for our daily bug hunts. A young
          Rogue called Yosan comes over to introduce herself. Yosan the Brave:
          &ldquo;On my recent travels into the outside world, I had found a
          mysterious 9 hole mini-golf course that looks like it has never seen a
          days worth of play. I dont think I have seen a monument like this ever
          before and truth be told, I have never seen a man under 30 who
          actively enjoyed the game of golf. Nevertheless, I found a mysterious
          tool in the clearing that looks like it could be useful? Perhaps an
          old Pirate?&rdquo;

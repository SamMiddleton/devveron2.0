          You walk into a brightly lit Tavern, there is a warm fire in the
          hearth and drinks flow freely. The [Barkeeper] looks your way and
          greets you warmly, the [Waitress] heads towards you to take your
          order, there is a [Thug] lurking by the stairs and a [Merchant] sits
          at a window seat with many empty glasses in front of him. Behind you
          is the door leading out to the{' '}

          In the bar, Lady Shrena and world famous Potter Emily S are having a
          nice Sav in long flute glasses. It appears they are talking about high
          culture and the colour patterns of couches. Further down along you see
          a straggly Pirate who looks like he has been out on sea for a long
          time. He has a luscious flowing beard and a mane that belies a man of
          great adventure and joy. Peg legged, he has a putting golf club for a
          foot.

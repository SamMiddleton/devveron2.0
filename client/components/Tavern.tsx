          You walk into a brightly lit Tavern, there is a warm fire in the
          hearth and drinks flow freely. The [Barkeeper] looks your way and
          greets you warmly, the [Waitress] heads towards you to take your
          order, there is a [Thug] lurking by the stairs and a [Merchant] sits
          at a window seat with many empty glasses in front of him. Behind you
          is the door leading out to the [Town Square].
